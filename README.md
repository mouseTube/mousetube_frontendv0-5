## What is mouseTube?

**mouseTube** is a database designed to facilitate sharing, archiving, and analyzing raw recording files of rodent ultrasonic vocalizations following the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles ([Wilkinson et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18)).

> **Info:**  
> This is a temporary version of **mouseTube**.  
> This version uses the same database as the initial version but with more recent and safer technologies. The main improvement is that data are now accessible without authentication.  
> If you want to share vocalization files, please contact us. This version does not allow to share files, but we can do it manually.  
> We are currently developing a new version with more functionalities.
